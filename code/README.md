# Assignment 1 - R code

This folder contains the R scripts used to solve the assignment.
There are 3 files:
 * **solution.R** : loads the data and compute the solution as a single list of parameters
 * **routines.R** : contains the functions used to process the data
 * **plots.R** : contains the function used to generate the plot in the report
 * **draw_plot.R** : loads the data and generate the plot

NB: the R script requires the package *e1071* to compute the exstimated excess kurtosis of the dataset.
