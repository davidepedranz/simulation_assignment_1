# Characterization of a population parameters
This repository contains the solution of the Assignment e of [Simulation and Performance Evaluation](http://disi.unitn.it/locigno/teaching-duties/spe/),
winter 2016 - 2017, University of Trento.

The assignment consisted in taking a noisy dataset of measures of the output of a circuitry (known to generate i.i.d. samples taken from a population with a logistic distribution), cleanup the data and recover the parameter of both the circuitry population and the noise.
More details are available in the [assignment.pdf](assignment.pdf) file.
